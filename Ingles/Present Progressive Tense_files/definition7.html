The <font color="olive"><font size="+1">PRESENT PROGRESSIVE TENSE</font></font> indicates continuing action, something going on now. This tense is formed with the helping "to be" verb, in the present tense, plus the present participle of the verb (with an <i>-ing</i> ending): "I <u>am buying</u> all my family's Christmas gifts early this year. She <u>is working</u> through the holiday break. Dierdre <u>is being</u> a really good girl in these days before Christmas".<p>

The present progressive can suggest that an action is going to happen in the future, especially with verbs that convey the idea of a plan or of movement from one place or condition to another: "The team <u>is arriving</u> in two hours. He<u>'s moving</u> to Portland this summer." Because the present progressive can suggest either the present or the future, it is usually modified by adverbs of time.</p></b></font><p><font color="purple"><b>

Generally, progressive forms occur only with what are called dynamic verbs and  not with stative verbs. If you wish to review that concept now, click
